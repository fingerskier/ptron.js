# ptron.js
Javascript perceptron class and framework


## Meta

This is a small, javascript only perceptron.
A perceptron is basically a solver for a system of linear equations.
The co-efficients of the equations can be determined automatically if we know which inputs map to which outputs.
The process is called back-propogation.
Small perceptrons can be trained and run locally.
The solutions given are fuzzy but with diligent design and training they can be accurate enough.
